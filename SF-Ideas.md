# Ideas from the Big Book of Science Fiction


## A Modest Genius: [Vadim Shefner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadim_Shefner)

Wonderful and strange imaginary technological objects:

* FED Camera shooting the future

>“It’s a very ordinary [FED camera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FED_(camera)) but it has an accessory that I built just recently. With it you can photograph the future. ?You aim the camera at a place whose future appearance you’d like to know, and take the picture. But my machine isn’t perfected yet. You can photograph things only three years ahead, no more than that as yet.” “Three years! That’s a lot. What a wonderful invention!” “Wonderful? Not at all,” said Sergei with a disdainful gesture. “It’s very imperfect.” “Have you taken any pictures?” “Yes. A short time ago I went out to the suburbs and shot some film there.” He took several prints from his desk.
