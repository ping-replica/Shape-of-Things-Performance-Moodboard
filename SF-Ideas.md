## Ideas from the Big Book of Science Fiction



##### The Astronaut: [Valentina Zhuravlyova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sever_Gansovsky)

Very beautiful way of bringing in the idea of the hybrid, the scientst and the artist; the dreamer, the passionate and the rational. It unifies the emotional with the intellectual in a wonderful way. 

I love the way it comments on Zarubi's blue painting.

>"A Study in Blue"

>"Two fragile human figures—a man and a woman—with strap-on wings were flying side by side through a blue sky. Everything was painted in different shades of blue, but I had never seen so many. It was a night sky, blue-black, on the lower left edge and a transparent warm midday blue in the opposite corner. The people’s wings were painted in shades of light and dark blue, shading into violet. At points the colors were harsh, clear, sparkling, and in other parts they were softer, muted, transparent. Next to this painting, Degas’s Blue Dancers would have seemed very limited and poorly colored.

##### A Modest Genius: [Vadim Shefner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadim_Shefner)

Wonderful and strange imaginary technological objects / poetic technology:

* FED Camera shooting the future

>“It’s a very ordinary [FED camera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FED_(camera)) but it has an accessory that I built just recently. With it you can photograph the future. [...] You can photograph things only three years ahead"

* Quarrel Measurer

>"The apparatus had a scale with twenty divisions, which measured the mood of the lodger and the intensity of a quarrel that might be going on. The needle trembled at the first unfriendly word and slowly approached the red line. If it reached the line, the Quarrel Ender went into action. Soft, soothing music filled the room; an automatic atomizer emitted a cloud of valerian and White Night perfume; and on the screen of the machine appeared a fellow who leaped about in a comical way, bowed low to the viewers, and kept repeating: “Be at peace with one another, citizens!”

* Skiing on water

* Telescope by making a windowpane with the properties of a gigantic magnifying glass allowing to see the canals of Mars or the craters of the Moon.

* SPOSEM (Special Purpose Optical Solar Energy Machine) - for restoring someone's youth.

##### Day of Wrath: [Sever Gansovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sever_Gansovsky)

Interesting ideas:

> “What Is a Man?”
>“In our century of astounding developments in science one might be forgiven for concluding that science is all-powerful. But let us imagine for a moment that an artificial brain has been created, twice as powerful as the human brain and possessing twice the capacity for work. Would a creature with a brain of this type really be allowed to call itself a man? What is it that makes us what we are? The capacity to perform sums, to analyze, to make logical deductions; or is it something else, which arises with the development of society, which is to do with an individual’s relation to others and with the relation of the individual to the collective? If we take the otarks as an example…”
