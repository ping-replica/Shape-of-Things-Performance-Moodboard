* FED Camera shooting the future

Would a creature with a brain of this type really be allowed to call itself a man? What is it that makes us what we are? The capacity to perform sums, to analyze, to make logical deductions; or is it something else, which arises with the development of society, which is to do with an individual’s relation to others and with the relation of the individual to the collective? If we take the otarks as an example…”
