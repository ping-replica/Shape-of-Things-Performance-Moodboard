# Ideas from the Big Book of Science Fiction


## A Modest Genius: [Vadim Shefner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadim_Shefner)

Wonderful and strange imaginary technological objects:

* FED Camera shooting the future

>“It’s a very ordinary FED camera but it has an accessory that I built just recently. With it you can photograph the future. ?>You aim the camera at a place whose future appearance you’d like to know, and take the picture. But my machine isn’t >perfected yet. You can photograph things only three years ahead, no more than that as yet.” “Three years! That’s a lot. What >a wonderful invention!” “Wonderful? Not at all,” said Sergei with a disdainful gesture. “It’s very imperfect.” “Have you ?>taken any pictures?” “Yes. A short time ago I went out to the suburbs and shot some film there.” He took several prints from >his desk.
